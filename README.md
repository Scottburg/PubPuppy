# Pub Puppy	
Some geezer trying to sell you 3 month old pure breed for £50 down the nags?

Suspect that the dog might be as kosher as the hot dogs sold outside the night club at 3am?

Then you need Pub Puppy!

Simply scan the chip in the dogs shoulder ( if there's a bloody wound there and no chip, pass on the pup)

Then use the chip number check to see if the pup is on the blockchain.

To assure yourself that this trenchcoat'd fella is the rightful owner ask him to transfer the dog to you using Pub Puppy.

If he can't give him a swift right hook then get fat Mike to sit on him till the police arrive.

No one likes a dog thief!  

Otherwise buy the mutt and enjoy the another pint with your new drinking buddy.

Pub Puppy is built in Solidity and React.
